Final assignment for CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python. This assignment 
involved recreating the classic arcade game, “Breakout”. Modified code is in state.py, 
breakout/play.py, and breakout/breakout.py.

The purpose of this assignment was to develop a basic understanding of programming animation,
utilize the usefullness of helper functions, and to be able to apply core concepts learned
throughout the year, such as loops, classes/subclasses, error handling, and program
structure vs. program flow.
